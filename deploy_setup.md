# Production Deployment Setup

## Issue Fixed
The deployment was failing because the Rails application was missing the `secret_key_base` for the production environment.

## Solution Applied
1. Created a `master.key` file in the `config/` directory
2. Added `secret_key_base` configuration to both `config/application.rb` and `config/environments/production.rb`
3. The application will now use the environment variable `SECRET_KEY_BASE` if available, or fall back to the generated key

## For Railway Deployment
You need to set the `SECRET_KEY_BASE` environment variable in your Railway project:

1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Navigate to the "Variables" tab
3. Add a new environment variable:
   - **Name**: `SECRET_KEY_BASE`
   - **Value**: `rLROSTe4TOZ8CMb/91N/55hM1tauGtDILsRLSH0woVg=`

## Alternative: Generate a New Key
If you want to generate a new secret key, you can run:
```bash
rails secret
```

Then use that value for the `SECRET_KEY_BASE` environment variable.

## Security Note
- The `master.key` file is automatically ignored by `.gitignore`
- Never commit the master key to version control
- Use environment variables for production deployments

## Next Steps
1. Set the `SECRET_KEY_BASE` environment variable in Railway
2. Redeploy your application
3. The deployment should now succeed
